<p><justify>This site is designed to assist people in making discrimination complaints
  with the Florida Commission on Human Relations, the state agency that handles discrimination complaints. These complaints are made
  by individuals against their employers, their landlords, or against a "public
  accomodation" - a fancy way of saying "restaurant, hotel, motel,gasoline station,
  theater, or certain other public places or accommodations."</p>
  <p>You can begin by researching the final decisions of the FCHR or by walking
    through the complaint process.</p>
<p>This site is not affiliated with the Florida Commission on Human Relations.
  This site was built to assist people in filing discrimination complaints, and
  in researching the results of past complaints.</p>
